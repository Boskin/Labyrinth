Description / Keypoints
This is a prototype engine for an overhead 2D game. The room system uses dynamic memory allocation within a linked
list data structure to handle the appearances and disappearances of objects at runtime such as bullets being fired
and expiring.

Compilation
Compilation requires a GNU C++ compiler (g++) as well as the make build utility.
Direct a terminal window to the directory of the makefile and type make to build the application.
